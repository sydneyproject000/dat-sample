    "### Lab:  Model Validation With Decision Trees\n",

    "Welcome to this evening's lab!  It's going to be a fun one.  For today's class, we're going to try and take a crack at model building in a wholistic way.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Specifically, we're going to try and do three different things:\n",
    "\n",
    " - Try out different versions of our data, and use our validation scores to see if something was an improvement or not\n",
    " - We're going to adjust model parameters to try and adjust our results to help curb overfitting\n",
    " - We're going to try and find model parameters that maximize our score for our dataset\n",
    " \n",
    "The idea is that we'll be able to do a mini-walkthrough to test what it's like to build and validate a model and try and improve our results."

    "\n",
    "The idea here is two-fold:  see if you can narrow the gap between in-sample and out-of-sample results (using training & validation sets), while simultaneously **not** decreasing your model scores (or at least not by very much).  The idea being that the closer these two are, the more reliable your results are likely to be.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some knobs you can turn:\n",
    " - `min_samples_leaf`: parameter in the category encoder that determines what cutoff point you can use for using the local vs. global average for the category.  (A decent rule of thumb is to try and have at least 10 samples on a leaf, but feel free to try different values)\n",
    " - `max_features`: what portion of columns to use at each split.  This parameter will randomly sample columns at each split, which reduces the chance that random patterns within them will have a disproportionately large impact on your model.  Should be a fraction between 0 and 1 or the number of columns you want to include.  \n",
    " - You can also try the following:  remove and sort of max_depth on your tree, and just use `min_samples_leaf` as a way to prune unnecessary splits"
